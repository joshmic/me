TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Using file IO, from the docs:
"The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second
argument is another string containing a few characters describing the
way in which the file will be used. mode can be 'r' when the file will
only be read, 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name
will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written
to the file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for
both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be
assumed if it's omitted."

Very difficult to understand. Definitely need to study this topic
